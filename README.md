# Mobile_Game_AB_Test

[Cookie Cats](https://www.facebook.com/cookiecatsgame) is a mobile puzzle game developed by [Tactile Entertainment](https://tactilegames.com/). It's a classic "connect three" style puzzle game where the player must connect tiles of the same color in order to clear the board and win the level. As players progress through the game they will encounter gates that force them to wait some time before they can progress or make an in-app purchase.

An A/B test was conducted to determine if moving the gate from level 40 to level 30 would increase user (1-day and 7-day) retention. The goal of this project is to analyze the result of the AB test to see make a decision on whther we should launch the change. Seet the analysis and conclusion [here](https://github.com/chens28/Mobile_Game_AB_Test/blob/main/AB_Test.ipynb).
